 QCHFM: Quantum-Coherent Hybrid Flow Modeling

Welcome to the **QCHFM** project â€” a unified simulation framework that merges rigorous fluid dynamics, practical engineering methods, and quantum-inspired uncertainty modeling.

## ðŸŒŒ Overview

QCHFM is designed to simulate complex fluid behavior in chaotic and extreme environments, such as the Martian atmosphere. It combines:

- ðŸ§  **Theoretic Core**: Classical Navier-Stokes foundations with regularity filters
- ðŸ›  **Practice Layer**: Adaptive meshing, numerical solvers, and empirical tuning
- ðŸŽ² **Quantum Overlay**: Stochastic differential equations to capture uncertainty
- ðŸŒŒ **Singularity Tracking**: Dynamic zone-based analysis and corrections

## ðŸš€ Use Case: Mars Canyon Weather Stabilization

The current implementation models airflow within Valles Marineris on Mars. It simulates:
- Thermal gradientâ€“driven wind
- Terrain-influenced vectors
- Random micro-vortex formation
- Confidence heatmaps

## ðŸ›  How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. Run the simulation from `simulation/` or `notebooks/`

## ðŸ”® Vision

This project is extensible for Earth-based turbulence, extraterrestrial fluid control, and real-time simulation-feedback systems.
